# IERS

IERS stands for International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service.  

# Why

I wanted to automate downloads of data for use and learn a couple of ways to deal with data, hashing and email in PowerShell.  

The simple task via PowerShell to download files, hash the files for comparison, backup / archive previous files, and then open an Outlook email message to send it.
